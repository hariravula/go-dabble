# Tuple

* A finite sorted list of elements.
* Groups data.
* Typically immutable sequential collection.
* Element has related fields of different datatypes. 
* Change the fields to modify a tuple. 
* `+` and `*` can be applied to tuples. 
* Functions that return `error` along with a value use tuples. 
* This is how a go function returns multiple values.
